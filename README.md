SmartLabsUniminuto is an initiative to develop low-cost remote laboratories for programming in Python and Raspberry Pi, given the currently contingency under the CoVid-19 pandemic from two  perspectives: technical and educational. The key concept of the laboratory is Physical computing, you learn better programming if you interact devices as sensors or actuators. Also, the pedagogical aspects in the curriculum play an inportant role in learning (mediation) in engineering and computer science education.

The user or learner can program in two modes: textual-based and visual (with graphical blocks: Blockly).
